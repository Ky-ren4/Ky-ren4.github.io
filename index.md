Hello,
I am a computer science major at CSUF and (expected) to graduate in 2027

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6, Part 2:
This was the first lab that incorporated command line arguments as well as vectors, which in general made the coding process more complex but satisfying to figure out. Part 2 was my favorite part of the lab, since it involved many individual functions that played a role in a bigger function. It was also very satisfying to see it all come together in the end to create a game of blackjack.

* Lab 9, Part 2:
Both parts of this lab utilized other files as inputs, which made it more complex than previous labs but also interesting. The second part of the lab was my favorite, mainly because I enjoyed the premise of comparing the text from two distinct files with each other. The logic behind the string comparisons was also really satisfying to figure out, since it involved comparing string vectors containing the file text within.

* Lab 10, Part 1:
This lab in particular felt the most practical to code, mainly because of the actual manipulation of real world data. If I had to choose a favorite out of the two parts, it would be part 1 since the end result functioned like a database of counties that return data on a specified county. The cherry on top was the fact that the logic revolved around manipulating multi-dimensional vectors which was very interesting and satisfying to figure out.
